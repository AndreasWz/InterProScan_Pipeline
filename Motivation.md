# Why This Pipeline is Needed

## The Problem with InterPro REST API

The **InterPro REST API** has a significant limitation: it only returns **pre-computed domain annotations** that are already stored in the InterPro database. This means:

❌ **Limited coverage**: Only proteins with existing annotations in member databases (Pfam, SMART, CDD, etc.)  
❌ **No live predictions**: Cannot generate domain predictions for new or unannotated proteins  
❌ **Incomplete results**: Many proteins return empty results or 404 errors  
❌ **Static data**: Results don't include the latest prediction algorithms  

## What You See vs. What You Get

When you visit the **InterPro website** and search for a protein, you see rich domain annotations because the web interface runs **InterProScan** dynamically - generating predictions in real-time using the latest algorithms and databases.

However, the **REST API endpoints** like `/protein/UniProt/P12345/location/` only return pre-computed data, not these live predictions.

## The Solution: Our Pipeline

This pipeline bridges that gap by:

✅ **Fetching sequences** directly from UniProt  
✅ **Running InterProScan** via the web service (same as the website)  
✅ **Getting complete results** with all domain predictions  
✅ **Including confidence scores** and exact coordinates  
✅ **Providing fresh annotations** using the latest databases  

## Key Difference

| Method | Coverage | Freshness | Completeness |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| InterPro API | Limited | Static | Incomplete |
| Our Pipeline | Comprehensive | Live | Complete |

**Bottom line**: If you want the same rich domain annotations you see on the InterPro website, you need to run InterProScan directly - which is exactly what this pipeline does automatically for batch processing.
